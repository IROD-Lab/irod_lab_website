title: "Gravity compensation for serial robotic manipulators"
image: "serial.avif"
description: "Gravity compensation using mechanical springs allows eliminating the gravitational effect on robotic manipulators, thereby reducing the actuation energy and improving accuracy, safety, and robot performance. In this research, a novel gravity compensation design, called the “gear-spring module (GSM)”, is proposed and installed on serial robotic manipulators for gravity compensation. The proposed GSM-based design is characterized by structure compactness, less assemblage effort, ease of modularization, and high performance of gravity compensation."
