abstract="This paper presents a novel adjustable constant-force mechanism (ACFM) based on spring and gear transmission. The mechanism is constructed by combining two gear-spring units and a Sarrus linkage. The significance of this design is that it can provide a constant force, which can be adjustable, over a large displacement. The adjustment of the output force is energy-free through a change in the spring position without spring preload. This work first explains the geometric constraints and desired parameters of the ACFM. Then, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the performance of the mechanism. Moreover, this paper also shows a prototype and experiments with an ACFM. It was found that the ACFM could provide a constant force of up to 20 N within a range of 140 mm, and the force error is less than 6{\%}.",

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel adjustable constant-force mechanism (CFM) using a geared Sarrus linkage and a linear spring. The uniqueness of this design is that it provides a constant force over a wide range of displacement and the constant-force level can be adjusted energy-freely by varying the spring position without a preload. In this work, the construction, geometric constraints, and constant-force design of the CFM are expressed. The desired parameters of the mechanism, with consideration of gear friction, are also determined. A numerical example is then given to illustrate the constant-force performance and the effect of gear friction. This paper also shows a prototype of a CFM and experimental studies on it. It was found that the CFM delivered a constant force of up to 20 N within a stroke of 140 mm, and the force error was less than 6%. Moreover, the CFM compensated for masses of 1 and 2 kg with a torque reduction of more than 90%.}

abstract = {This paper presents a design approach for gravity compensators using planar four-bar mechanisms and a linear spring. This work enables the development of a class of gravity compensators encompassing 42 different types, which are characterized by high performance and kinematic simplicity. The gravity compensators are constructed by combining planar four-bar mechanisms with a rotating mass and attaching a linear spring to each mechanism, then permuting the springs. The parameters of the gravity compensators are derived from an optimization procedure that minimizes the actuator torque within a specified balancing zone. The performances of the gravity compensators were demonstrated via both numerical examples and experiments. The results showed their design feasibilities and high performances in which a torque reduction rate of 87.8% was practically achieved. Lastly, an application of the proposed gravity compensators to serial robots is described. It was found that the actuator torque of a serial robot over a prescribed workspace could theoretically be reduced by 98.2%. A prototype of a serial robot was also built to validate the applicability of the gravity compensators.}
